        Welcome to the Campaign Prioritizer Tool!

        **Tool Overview:**
           The tool was built to help your campaign determine which precinct to focus canvassing efforts on by strategic considerations important to your campaign.

        **File Input:**
           You will need to input a csv file with the list of precincts and detailed associated data like demographics and previous election turnout.

        **Decision Parameter Weights:**
           These values are percentages and range from 0 to 1.0 for each parameter. The goal is to distribute the wieght percentages across all the decision parameters in such a way they add up to 1.0. The higher the number given to a parameter, the more it will play into the ranking of precincts. 
           You should work with your campaign management Data, and Field teams to determine the appropriate canvass strategy and select the weight values to accurately align.
           
        **Results:**
        - The results should be a helful aid to the campaign to determine where to allocate resources and time. 
        - Feel free to experiment and re-run with the different weights to see how much the prioritized list changes. 
        - Its helpful to revisit at different parts of your campaign as factors and strategy may change.
